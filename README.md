# ChatGPT_Python
Interacting with ChatGPT via Python using voice-to-text or just text chat!

**Requirements:**
ChatGPT API Key: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

Python 3.10 installed and added to PATH: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

Pip3 v23.0: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

**Python Setup:**
  Use "pip install --upgrade <library>" for the following:
    
    - openai
    
    - pre-commit
    
    - tiktoken
    
    - SpeechRecognition
    
    - PyAudio

  
**General Use:**
  1. Obtain an API key from the link above
  
  2. Place the API key in a text file called api-key.txt in the source directory
  
  3. Run OpenChat.py and select whether you want to interact using voice or text. Just say "stop listening" to end your conversation or CTRL+C to kill the process.
  
  More features and optimizations to come!  
  
  
  
  
  

**Troubleshooting:**
    
    Google voice to text call sometimes doesn't work if using onboard laptop microphone. I've had the most luck using a gaming headset, bluetooth earbuds and wired.
