# ChatGPT_Python
Interacting with ChatGPT via Python using voice-to-text or just text chat!

Run OpenChat.py and fill in your API token where chatbot is instantiated before the main while True loop. Just tell it to "stop listening" when you are finished with your conversation! New features to come.

Requirements:
ChatGPT API Key: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
Python 3.10 installed and added to PATH: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
Pip3 v23.0: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

Python Setup:
  Use "pip install --upgrade <library>" for the following:
    - openai
    - pre-commit
    - tiktoken
    - SpeechRecognition
    - PyAudio


Troubleshooting:
    Google voice to text call sometimes doesn't work if using onboard laptop microphone. I've had the most luck using a gaming headset, bluetooth earbuds and wired.
